C++ Software developer | Learning Rust

---

Hi, This is CcydtN. My previous job is to develop embedded software for optical network products using C++17.

I'm learning Rust as a hobby. Right now, it is my favorite programming language. Most of my recent projects are written using Rust. Hopefully, I can get a Rust developer job in the future.

I set this up, to encourage myself to do more writting. Try writing down some ideas, thoughts, and development of projects. Not sure if it can help me improve or not, but trying new things is always better than doing nothing.
